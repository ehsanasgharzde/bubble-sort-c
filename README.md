# Bubble Sort C Program

## Description

This C program demonstrates the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system.

2. Compile the program using your C compiler.

    ```bash
    gcc main.c -o bubble_sort
    ```

3. Run the compiled program.

    ```bash
    ./bubble_sort
    ```

## About Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.

## Example

Suppose the input array is: {5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3, 0}

The program will sort it in ascending order and print the sorted array as: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7


Happy coding!
